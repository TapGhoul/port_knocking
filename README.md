# Port Knocking

A little port knocking toy I threw together in my spare time.

Doesn't do any firewall stuff, and could probably be built better, with loads of potential points of panic, but it's a
fun little toy.

This is not a security product. Do not use it as one. Do not use port knocking as a primary method of securing anything
serious in the first place. I will personally wear a leopard costume and eat your face if you do.
